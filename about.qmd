# Website

We build the website using [quarto](https://quarto.org/) which is perfect from transforming [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ pages into a website with minimal investment. See this [wiki page](https://github.com/BigelowLab/ColbyForecasting2025/wiki/Quarto) if you would like to add your work to you own fork of the class repository.
